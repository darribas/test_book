Science&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this first tutorial we will introduce the main tools we will be working with throughout the rest of the course. Although very basic and seemingly abstract, everything showed here will become the basis on top of which we will build more sophisticated (and fun) tasks. But, before, let us get to know the tools that will give us data super-powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Source&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course will introduce you to a series of computational tools that make the life of the Data Scientist possible, and much easier. All of them are open-source, which means the creators of these pieces of software have made available the source code for people to use it, study it, modify it, and re-distribute it. This has allowed a large eco-system that today represents the best option for scientific computing, and is used widely both in industry and academia. Thanks to this, this course can be taught with entirely freely available tools that you can install in any of your computers.\nIf you want to learn more about open-source and free software, here are a few links:\n\n[Video]: brief explanation of open source.\n[Book] The Cathedral and the Bazaar: classic book, freely available, that documents the benefits and history of open-source software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter Notebook&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main computational tool you will be using during this course is the Jupyter notebook. Notebooks are a convenient way to thread text, code and the output it produces in a simple file that you can then share, edit and modify. You can think of notebooks as the Word document of Data Scientists, just better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a notebook&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to begin a notebook session, you need to do it from what is called the command line, a terminal window that allows you to interact with your computer through written commands. This is how you can fire up a terminal:\n\nIf you are on a Windows computer, you can start PowerShell from the Start menu (cmd prompt). \nOn a Mac, fire up the Terminal.app utility. \nIn Linux, use any of the terminals available.\n\nThen type the following command\n\n&gt; source activate gds\nNOTE: ignore source if you are on Windows and simply type activate gds.\nThen launch Jupyter by typing on the same terminal:\n\n&gt; jupyter notebook\nThis should bring up a browser window with a home page that looks more or less like this (although with a different list of files probably):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate until the folder where you have placed the lab_01.ipynb file for this tutorial and click on it. This will open the notebook on a different tab. You are now on the interactive version of the notebook!\nWhen you are finished with the session, you can save the notebook with File -&gt; Save and Checkpoint. Everything you do on the notebook (text, code and output) is saved into an .ipynb file that you can open later, share, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCells&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main building block of notebooks are cells. These are chunks of the same time of content which can be cut, pasted, and moved around in a notebook. Cells can be of two types:\n\nText, like the one where this is written.\nCode, like the following one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[1]:\n\n    \n# This is a code cell\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create a new cell by clicking Insert -&gt; Cell Above/Below in the top menu. By default, this will be a code cell, but you can change that on the Cell -&gt; Cell Type menu. Choose Markdown for a text cell. Once a new cell is created, you can edit it by clicking on it, which will create the cursor bar inside for you to start typing.\nPro tip!: cells can also be created with shortcuts. If you press &lt;escape&gt; and then b (a), a new cell will be created below (above). There is a whole bunch of shortcuts you can explore by pressing &lt;escape&gt; and h (press &lt;escape&gt; again to leave the help).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and its output&#182;A particularly useful feature of notebooks is that you can save, in the same place, the code you use to generate any output (tables, figures, etc.). As an example, the cell below contains a snipet of Python that returns a printed statement. This statement is then printed below and recorded in the notebook as output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[2]:\n\n    \nprint(&quot;Hello world!!!&quot;)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello world!!!\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote also how the notebook has automatic syntax highlighting support for Python. This makes the code much more readable and understandable. More on Python below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText cells in a notebook use the Github Flavored Markdown markup language. This means you can write plain text with some rules and the notebook renders a more visually appealing version of it. Let's see some examples:\n\nBOLD:\n\nThis is **bold**.\nIs rendered:\nThis is bold.\n\nITALIC:\n\nThis is *italic*.\nIs rendered:\nThis is italic.\n\nLISTS:\n\nYou can create unnumbered lists:\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2\n* ...\nWhich will produce:\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\n...\n\nOr you can create numbered lists:\n\n1. First element\n1. Second element\n1. ...\nAnd get:\n\nFirst element\nSecond element\n...\n\nNote that you don't have to write the actual number of the element, just using 1. always produces a numbered list.\nYou can also nest lists:\n\n* First unnumbered element, which can be split into:\n\n    1. One numbered element\n    2. Another numbered element\n\n* Second element.\n* ...\n\nFirst unnumbered element, which can be split into:\n\nOne numbered element\nAnother numbered element\n\n\nSecond element.\n\n...\n\nThis creates many oportunities to combine things nicely.\n\nLINKS\n\nYou can easily create hyperlinks, for example to [WikiPedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).\nYou can easily create hyperlinks, for example to WikiPedia.\n\nHEADINGS: including # before a line causes it to render a heading.\n\n\n# This is Header 1\nTurns into:\nThis is Header 1&#182;\n## This is Header 2\nTurns into:\nThis is Header 2&#182;\n### This is Header 3\nTurns into:\nThis is Header 3&#182;And so on...\n\nYou can see a more in detail introduction in the following links:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRich content in a notebook&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotebooks can also include rich content from the web. For that, we need to import the display module:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[3]:\n\n    \nimport IPython.display as display\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes available additional functionality that allows us to embed rich content. For example, we can include a YouTube clip easily by passing it's ID:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[4]:\n\n    \ndisplay.YouTubeVideo(&#39;iinQDhsdE9s&#39;)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[4]:\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can pass standard HTML code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[5]:\n\n    \ndisplay.HTML(&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Header 1&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Header 2&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[5]:\n\n\n\n\nHeader 1\nHeader 2\n\n\nrow 1, cell 1\nrow 1, cell 2\n\n\nrow 2, cell 1\nrow 2, cell 2\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this opens the door for including a large number of elements from the web, as an iframe is also allowed. For example, interactive maps can be included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[6]:\n\n    \nosm = &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=-2.9662737250328064%2C53.400500637844594%2C-2.964626848697662%2C53.402550738394034&amp;amp;layer=mapnik&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/53.40153/-2.96545&quot;&gt;View Larger Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\ndisplay.HTML(osm)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[6]:\n\n\n\nView Larger Map\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr sound content:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[7]:\n\n    \nsound = &#39;&#39;&#39;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178720725&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&#39;&#39;&#39;\ndisplay.HTML(sound)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[7]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nA more thorough exploration of them is available in this notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise to work on your own&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to reproduce, using markdown and the different tools the notebook affords you, the following WikiPedia entry:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_chip_cookie_dough_ice_cream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[8]:\n\n    \ndisplay.IFrame(&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_chip_cookie_dough_ice_cream&#39;, \n              700, 500)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[8]:\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nPay special attention in getting the bold, italics, links, headlines and lists correctly formated. Bonus if you manage to insert the image as well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we will have a look at other programs, the main bulk of the course relies on the Python programming language. Python is a high-level programming language widely used today. To give a couple of examples of its relevance, it is underlying most of the Dropbox systems, but also heavily used to control satellites at NASA. A great deal of Science is also done in Python, from research in astronomy at UC Berkley, to courses in economics by Nobel Prize Professors.\nThis course uses Python because it has emerged as one of the main and most solid options for Data Science, together with other free alternatives such as R. Python is widely used for data processing and analysis both in academia and in industry. There is a vibrant and growing scientific community (example and example), working at both universities and companies, that supports and enhances its capabilities for data analysis by providing new and refining existing extensions (a.ka.a. libraries, see below). In the geospatial world, Python is also very widely adopted, being the selected language for scripting in both ArcGIS and QGIS. All of this means that, whether you are thinking of continuing in Higher Education or trying to find a job in industry, Python will be an importan asset that employers will significantly value.\nBeing a high-level language means that the code can be \"dynamically interpreted\", which means it is run on-the-fly without the need to be compiled. This is in contrast to \"low-level\" programming languages, which first need to be converted into machine code (i.e. compiled) before they can be run. With Python, one does not need to worry about compilation and can just write code, evaluate, fix it, re-evaluate it, etc. in a quick cycle, making it a very productive tool. The rest of this tutorial covers some of the basic elements of the language, from conventions like how to comment your code, to the basic data structures available.\nThe rest of the tutorial is partly inspired by the introductory lesson in this course by Lorena Barba's group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython libraries&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard Python language includes some data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries, etc. See below) and allows many basic operations (e.g. sum, product, etc.). For example, right out of the box, and without any further action needed, you can use Python as a calculator:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[9]:\n\n    \n3 + 5\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[9]:\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[10]:\n\n    \n2. / 3\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[10]:\n\n\n\n0.6666666666666666\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[11]:\n\n    \n(3 + 5) * 2. / 3\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[11]:\n\n\n\n5.333333333333333\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the strength of Python as a data analysis tool comes from the extensions provided separately that add functionality and provide access to much more sophisticated data structures and functions. These come in the form of packages, or libraries, that once installed need to be imported into a session.\nIn this course, we will be using many of the core libraries of what has been called the \"PyData stack\", the set of libraries that make Python a full-fledge system for Data Science. We will introduce them gradually as we need them for particular tasks but, for now, let us have a look at the foundational library, numpy (short for numerical Python). Importing it is simple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[12]:\n\n    \nimport numpy as np # we rename it in the session as `np` by convention\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how we import it and rename it in the session, from numpy to np, which is shorter and more convenient.\nNote also how comments work in Python: everything in a line after the # sign is ignored by Python when it evaluates the code. This allows you to insert comments that Python will ignore but that can help you and others better understand the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce imports are out of the way, let us start exploring what we can do with numpy. One of the easiest tasks is to create a sequence of numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[13]:\n\n    \nseq = np.arange(10)\nseq\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[13]:\n\n\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note is that, in line 1, we create the sequence by calling the function arange and assign it to an object called seq (it could have been called anything else, pick your favorite) and, in line 2, we have it printed as the output of the cell.\nAnother interesting feature is how, since we are calling a numpy function called arange by adding np. in front. This is to note that the function comes explicitly from numpy. To find out how necessary this is, you can try generating the sequence without np:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[14]:\n\n    \nseq = arange(10)\nseq\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-14-8381d1c402c4&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()\n----&gt; 1 seq = arange(10)\n      2 seq\n\nNameError: name &#39;arange&#39; is not defined\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you get instead is an error, also called a \"traceback\". In particular, Python is telling that it cannot find a function named arange in the core library. This is because that particular function is only available in numpy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA basic feature of Python is the ability to assign a name to different \"things\", or objects. These can also be called sometimes \"variables\". We have already seen that in the example above but, to make it more explicit, let us make it even simpler. For example, an object can be a single number:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[15]:\n\n    \na = 3\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr a name, also called \"string\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[16]:\n\n    \nb = &#39;Hello World&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check what type an object is also easily:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[17]:\n\n    \ntype(a)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[17]:\n\n\n\nint\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nint is short for \"integer\" which, roughly speaking, means an whole number. If you want to save a number with decimals, you will be using floats:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[18]:\n\n    \nc = 1.5\ntype(c)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[18]:\n\n\n\nfloat\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, what we understand as letters in a wide sense (spaces and other signs count too) is called \"strings\" (str in short):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[19]:\n\n    \ntype(b)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[19]:\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA very handy feature of Python is the ability to access on-the-spot help for its different functions. This means that you can check what a function is supposed to do, or how to access it, right inside your Python session. Of course, this also works handsomely inside a notebook. There are a couple of ways to access the help.\nTake the numpy function arange that we have used above. The easiest way to check interactively how to use it is by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[20]:\n\n    \nnp.arange?\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this brings up a sub-window in the browser with all the information you need.\nIf, for whatever reason, you needed to print that info into the notebook itself, you can do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[21]:\n\n    \nhelp(np.arange)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp on built-in function arange in module numpy.core.multiarray:\n\narange(...)\n    arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)\n\n    Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.\n\n    Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``\n    (in other words, the interval including `start` but excluding `stop`).\n    For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in\n    `range &lt;http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html&gt;`_ function,\n    but returns an ndarray rather than a list.\n\n    When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, the results will often not\n    be consistent.  It is better to use ``linspace`` for these cases.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    start : number, optional\n        Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default\n        start value is 0.\n    stop : number\n        End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except\n        in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point\n        round-off affects the length of `out`.\n    step : number, optional\n        Spacing between values.  For any output `out`, this is the distance\n        between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``.  The default\n        step size is 1.  If `step` is specified, `start` must also be given.\n    dtype : dtype\n        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data\n        type from the other input arguments.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    arange : ndarray\n        Array of evenly spaced values.\n\n        For floating point arguments, the length of the result is\n        ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``.  Because of floating point overflow,\n        this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater\n        than `stop`.\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    linspace : Evenly spaced numbers with careful handling of endpoints.\n    ogrid: Arrays of evenly spaced numbers in N-dimensions.\n    mgrid: Grid-shaped arrays of evenly spaced numbers in N-dimensions.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3)\n    array([0, 1, 2])\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3.0)\n    array([ 0.,  1.,  2.])\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3,7)\n    array([3, 4, 5, 6])\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3,7,2)\n    array([3, 5])\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nControl flow (a.k.a. for loops and if statements)&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this does not intend to be a comprehensive introduction to computer programming or general purpose Python (check the references for that, in particular Allen Downey's book), it is important to be aware of two building blocks of almost any computer program: for loops and if statements. It is possible that you will never require them for this course, as all that is used here is based on existing methods and functions, but it is always useful to know they exist and to be able to recognize them. They can also come in very handy in cases where you some extra functionality out of standard methods. Without further ado, let us have a look and the two single most relevant tools of computer programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor loops\n\nThese allow  you to repeat a particular action or task over a sequence. As an example, you can print your name ten times without having to type it yourself every single time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[22]:\n\n    \nfor i in np.arange(10):\n    print &#39;my name&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote a couple of features in the loop:\n\nYou loop over a sequence, in this particular case the sequence of ten numbers created by np.arange(10).\nIn every step, for every element of the sequence in this case, you repeat an action. Here we are printing the same text, my name.\nAlthough not used in this simple loop, each of the elements you loop over can be accessed inside the loop. This can be irrelevant, as in the loop above, or extremely useful, it depends on the context. For example, see a case where you use the value of the sequence in each step:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[23]:\n\n    \nfor i in np.arange(10):\n    print &quot;I am at step &quot;, i\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am at step  0\nI am at step  1\nI am at step  2\nI am at step  3\nI am at step  4\nI am at step  5\nI am at step  6\nI am at step  7\nI am at step  8\nI am at step  9\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more note: for convention, we are calling the element of the sequence i, but this could be named anything. In fact, in many cases, more meaningful names make code much more readable. For example, you could think of a re-write of the loop above as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[24]:\n\n    \nfor step in np.arange(10):\n    print &quot;I am at step &quot;, step\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am at step  0\nI am at step  1\nI am at step  2\nI am at step  3\nI am at step  4\nI am at step  5\nI am at step  6\nI am at step  7\nI am at step  8\nI am at step  9\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif statements\n\nWe have just seen how for loops allow you to repeat an action over a sequence. In the case of if statements, these allow you to select or restrict such actions to only those cases that meet a condition(s) you specify in the statement.\nFor example, if you think of the loops written above, you might want to only print those that are odd, skipping those that are even:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[25]:\n\n    \nfor i in np.arange(10):\n    if i%2:\n        print i\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnore for the moment the part i%2, just remember this is one way Python has to check if a number is odd. The important bit in this loop, as compared to the simpler one above, is that we are using an if statement to select only those candidates that meet the condition. In other words, what we are doing it looping over every number in the sequence from zero to nine (for i in np.arange(10)) and checking if they are even or odd (if i%2). If they meet the condition, they are odd, then we proceed and print them on the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full if statement also allows for an action to be taken if the original condition is not satisfied. This is called an \"ifelse\" statement. For example, you can think of a loop that prints the type of each number in a sequence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[26]:\n\n    \nfor i in np.arange(10):\n    # Check if it is odd\n    if i%2:\n        print i, &#39; is odd&#39;\n    # If not odd (even), then do the following\n    else:\n        print i, &#39; is even&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0  is even\n1  is odd\n2  is even\n3  is odd\n4  is even\n5  is odd\n6  is even\n7  is odd\n8  is even\n9  is odd\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nData structures&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard python you can access without importing any additional libraries contains a few core data structures that is very handy to know. Most of data analysis is done on top of other structures specifically designed for the purpose (numpy arrays and pandas dataframes, mostly. See the following sessions for more details), but some understanding of these core Python structures is very useful. In this context, we will look at three: values, lists, and dictionaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues: these are the most basic elements to organize data and information in Python. You can think of them as numbers (integers or floats) or words (strings). Typically, these are the elements that will be stored in lists and dictionaries.\n\nAn integer is a whole number:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[27]:\n\n    \ni = 5\ntype(i)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[27]:\n\n\n\nint\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nA float is a number that allows for decimals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[28]:\n\n    \nf = 5.2\ntype(f)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[28]:\n\n\n\nfloat\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that a float can also not have decimals and still be stored as such:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[29]:\n\n    \nfw = 5.\ntype(fw)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[29]:\n\n\n\nfloat\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, they are different representations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[30]:\n\n    \nf == fw\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[30]:\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists: a list is an ordered sequence of values that can be of mixed types. They are represented between squared brackets ([]) and, although not very efficient in memory terms, are very flexible and useful to \"put things together\".\n\nFor example, the following list of integers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[31]:\n\n    \nl = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nl\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[31]:\n\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[32]:\n\n    \ntype(l)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[32]:\n\n\n\nlist\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the following mixed one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[33]:\n\n    \nm = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 5, &#39;c&#39;, 6, 7]\nm\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[33]:\n\n\n\n[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 5, &#39;c&#39;, 6, 7]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLists can be queried and sliced. For example, the first element can be retrieved by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[34]:\n\n    \nl[0]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[34]:\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the second to the fourth:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[35]:\n\n    \nm[1:4]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[35]:\n\n\n\n[&#39;b&#39;, 5, &#39;c&#39;]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLists can be added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[36]:\n\n    \nl + m\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[36]:\n\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 5, &#39;c&#39;, 6, 7]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNew elements added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[37]:\n\n    \nl.append(4)\nl\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[37]:\n\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr modified:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[38]:\n\n    \nl[1]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[38]:\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[39]:\n\n    \nl[1] = &#39;two&#39;\nl[1]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[39]:\n\n\n\n&#39;two&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[40]:\n\n    \nl\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[40]:\n\n\n\n[1, &#39;two&#39;, 3, 4, 5, 4]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries: dictionaries are unordered collections of \"keys\" and \"values\". A key, which can be of any kind, is the element associated with a \"value\", which can also be of any kind. Dictionaries are used when order is not important but you need fast and easy lookup. They are expressed in curly brackets, with keys and values being linked through columns.\n\nFor example, we can think of a dictionary to store a series of names and the ages of the people they represent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[41]:\n\n    \nages = {&#39;Ana&#39;: 24, &#39;John&#39;: 20, &#39;Li&#39;: 27, &#39;Ivan&#39;: 40, &#39;Tali&#39;:33}\nages\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[41]:\n\n\n\n{&#39;Ana&#39;: 24, &#39;Ivan&#39;: 40, &#39;John&#39;: 20, &#39;Li&#39;: 27, &#39;Tali&#39;: 33}\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[42]:\n\n    \ntype(ages)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[42]:\n\n\n\ndict\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries can then be queried and values retrieved easily by using their keys. For example, if we quickly want to know Li's age:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[43]:\n\n    \nages[&#39;Li&#39;]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[43]:\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to lists, you can modify and assign new values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[44]:\n\n    \nages[&#39;Juan&#39;] = 73\nages\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[44]:\n\n\n\n{&#39;Ana&#39;: 24, &#39;Ivan&#39;: 40, &#39;John&#39;: 20, &#39;Juan&#39;: 73, &#39;Li&#39;: 27, &#39;Tali&#39;: 33}\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this property, you can create entirely empty dictionaries and populate them later on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[45]:\n\n    \nnewdict = {}\nnewdict[&#39;key1&#39;] = 1\nnewdict[&#39;key2&#39;] = 2\nnewdict\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[45]:\n\n\n\n{&#39;key1&#39;: 1, &#39;key2&#39;: 2}\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last part of this whirlwind tour on Python relates to functions, or more properly termed, methods. The motivation is that, so far, we have only seen how you can create Python code that, if you want to run again somewhere else, you need to copy and paste entirely. However, as we will see in more detail later in the course, one of the main reasons why you want to use Python for data analysis, instead of a point-and-click graphical interface like SPSS, for instance, is that you can easily reuse code and re-run analyses easily. Methods help us accomplish this by encapsulating snippets of code that perform a particular task and making them available to be called.\nWe have already used methods here. When we call np.arange, we are using one of them. Now, we will see how to create a method of our own that performs the specific task we want it to do. For example, let us create a very simple method to reproduce the first loop we created above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[46]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loop():\n    for i in np.arange(10):\n        print i\n    return None\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready with this simple method, there is a bunch of interesting things going on:\n\nFirst, note how we define a bit of code is a method, as oposed to plain Python: we use def followed by the name of our function (we have chosen run_simple_loop, but we anything could have done).\nSecond, we append () after the name, and finish the line with a colon (:). This is necessary and will allow us to specify requirements for the function (see below).\nThird, realize that everything inside a function needs to be indented. This is a core property of Python and, although some people find it odd, it enhances readibility greatly.\nFourth, the piece of code to do the task we want, printing the sequence of numbers, is inside the function in the same way it was outside, only properly indented.\nFifth, we finish the method with a line starting by return. In this case, we follow it with None, but this will change as methods become more sophisticated. Essentially, this is the part of the method where you specify which elements you want it to return and save for later use.\n\nOnce we have paid attention to these elements, we can see how the method can be called and hence the code inside it executed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[47]:\n\n    \nrun_simple_loop()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the same way that we called np.arange before. Note how we do not include the colon (:) but simply use the name of the method followed by the parenthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the simplest possile method you can write: you do not require anything, just executing it, and the code produces and output (the printout) but it is not saved anywhere. The rest of this section relaxes these two aspects to allow us to build more complex, but also more useful, methods.\nFirst, you can specify \"arguments\" to be passed that modify the behaviour of the method. Remember how we called np.arange with a number that implied the length of the sequence we wanted returned. We can do the same thing in our own function. The main aspect to pay attention to in this context is that the arguments need to be variables, not particular values. Let us see a modified example of our method:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[48]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loopX(x):\n    for i in np.arange(x):\n        print i\n    return None\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have replaced the fixed length of the sequence (10) by a variable named x that allows us to specify any value we want when we call the method:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[49]:\n\n    \nrun_simple_loopX(3)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[50]:\n\n    \nrun_simple_loopX(2)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way you can build more flexibility into a method is by allowing it to return an output of the computation. In the previous examples, the function performs a computation (i.e. printing values on the screen), but it does not return any value. This is in contrast with, for example, np.arange which does return an output, the sequence of values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[51]:\n\n    \na = np.arange(10)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[52]:\n\n    \na\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[52]:\n\n\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOur function does not save anything:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[53]:\n\n    \nb = run_simple_loopX(3)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[54]:\n\n    \nb\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can modify this using the last line of a method. For example, let us assume we want to return a sequence as long as the series of numbers we print on the screen. The method should be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[55]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loopXout(x):\n    for i in np.arange(x):\n        print i\n    return np.arange(x)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the main difference: instead of returning None, we are telling Python to return a sequence, which has the same length as the one used to specify the loop. Now, there is an alternative way of being more efficient in this method, and that is assigning the sequence to a new object and using it when necessary later on. The results are exactly the same, but there are less computations performed and, more critically, we minimize the chances of making mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[56]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loopXout(x):\n    seq = np.arange(x)\n    for i in seq:\n        print i\n    return seq\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nEither of these two new versions of the method return an output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[57]:\n\n    \na = run_simple_loopX(3)\nb = run_simple_loopXout(3)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[58]:\n\n    \na\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[59]:\n\n    \nb\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[59]:\n\n\n\narray([0, 1, 2])\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of methods, as oposed to straight code, is that they force us to think in a modular way, helping us identify exactly what it needs to be done, in what order, and what it is required. Encapsulating these atomic bits of functionality in methods allows us to write things once and flexibly use them everywhere, saving us time (and headaches) in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA final note on functions. It is important that, whenever you create a function, you include some documentation about what it expects, what it does, and what it returns. Although there are many ways of doing this, the typical convention is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[60]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loopXout(x):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Print out the values of a sequence of certain length\n    ...\n    \n    Arguments\n    ---------\n    x     : int\n            Length of the sequence to be printed out\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    seq   : np.array\n            Sequence of values printed out\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    seq = np.arange(x)\n    for i in seq:\n        print i\n    return seq\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation, as any string, are highlighted in red on a notebook. Let us have a look at the structure and components of a well-made documentation (also called \"docstring\"):\n\nIt is encapsulated between triple commas (\"\"\").\nBegins with a short description of what the method does. The shorter the better, the more concise, the even better.\nThere is a section called \"Arguments\" that lists the elements that the function expects. \nEach argument is then listed, followed by its type. In this case it is an object x that, as we are told, needs to be an integer.\nThe arguments are followed by another section that specifies what the function returns, and of what type the output is.\n\nDocumentation in this way is very useful to remember what a function does, but also to force yourself to write clearer code. A bonus is that, if you include documentation in this way, it can be checked with the standard help or ? systems reviewed above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[61]:\n\n    \nrun_simple_loopXout?\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[62]:\n\n    \nhelp(run_simple_loopXout)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp on function run_simple_loopXout in module __main__:\n\nrun_simple_loopXout(x)\n    Print out the values of a sequence of certain length\n    ...\n\n    Arguments\n    ---------\n    x     : int\n            Length of the sequence to be printed out\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    seq   : np.array\n            Sequence of values printed out\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise to work on your own&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a properly documented function with the following behaviour:\n\nIt has a meaningful name (i.e. it is related to its behaviour).\nIt takes an integer that represents the length of a sequence that will be created.\nIt creates a dictionary that is empty.\nIt loops over the sequence and stores each number as the key of an entry in the dictionary, assigning either \"odd\" or \"even\" to the value, depending on the type of number.\nReturns the dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Data Science'15 - Lab 1 by Dani Arribas-Bel is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\n"},"chapter-1/lab3.html":{"url":"chapter-1/lab3.html","title":"Subchapter 1.4","body":"\n\n\n\n\nMapping in Python with geopandas&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[1]:\n\n    \n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pysal as ps\nfrom pysal.contrib.viz import mapping as maps\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this lab, we will learn how to load, manipulate and visualize spatial data. In some senses, spatial data have become so pervasive that nowadays, they are usually included simply as \"one more column\" in a table. However, spatial is special and there are few aspects in which geographic data differ from standard numerical tables. In this session, we will extend the skills developed in the previous one about non-spatial data, and combine them. In the process, we will discover that, although with some particularities, dealing with spatial data in Python largely resembles dealing with non-spatial data. For example, in this lab you will learn to make slick maps like this one with just a few commands:\n\nOr interactive ones like this one where the smallest areas of Liverpool are highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[2]:\n\n    \n# Please note this will not display on your machine as it depends on an external file\n# A rendered version can be found on the HTML or PDF versions of this notebook\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame(&quot;figs/lab03_liverpool_smallest.html&quot;, width=560, height=315)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[2]:\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn these concepts, we will be playing again with the geography of Liverpool. In particular we will use Census geographies (Available as part of the Census Data pack used before, see link) and Ordnance Survey geospatial data, available to download also from the CDRC data store (link). To make the rest of the notebook easier to follow, let us set the paths to the main two folders here. We will call the path to the Liverpool Census pack lcp_dir, and that to the OS geodata los_dir:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[3]:\n\n    \nlcp_dir = &#39;../../../../data/Liverpool/&#39;\nlos_dir = &#39;../../../../data/E08000012_OS/&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading up spatial data&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to get from a file to a quick visualization of the data is by loading it as a GeoDataFrame and calling the plot command. The main library employed for all of this is geopandas which is a geospatial extension of the pandas library, already introduced before. geopandas supports exactly the same functionality that pandas does (in fact since it is built on top of it, so most of the underlying machinery is pure pandas), plus a wide range of spatial counterparts that make manipulation and general \"munging\" of spatial data as easy as non-spatial tables.\nIn two lines of code, we will obtain a graphical representation of the spatial data contained in a file that can be in many formats; actually, since it uses the same drivers under the hood, you can load pretty much the same kind of vector files that QGIS permits. Let us start by plotting single layers in a crude but quick form, and we will build style and sophistication into our plots later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolygons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us begin with the most common type of spatial data in the social science: polygons. For example, we can load the geography of LSOAs in Liverpool with the following lines of code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[4]:\n\n    \nlsoas_link = lcp_dir + &#39;shapefiles/Liverpool_lsoa11.shp&#39;\nlsoas = gpd.read_file(lsoas_link)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lsoas is a GeoDataFrame. Very similar to a traditional, non-spatial DataFrame, but with an additional column called geometry:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[5]:\n\n    \nlsoas.head()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[5]:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      LSOA11CD\n      geometry\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      E01006512\n      POLYGON ((336103.358 389628.58, 336103.416 389...\n    \n    \n      1\n      E01006513\n      POLYGON ((335173.781 389691.538, 335169.798 38...\n    \n    \n      2\n      E01006514\n      POLYGON ((335495.676 389697.267, 335495.444 38...\n    \n    \n      3\n      E01006515\n      POLYGON ((334953.001 389029, 334951 389035, 33...\n    \n    \n      4\n      E01006518\n      POLYGON ((335354.015 388601.947, 335354 388602...\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows us to quickly produce a plot by executing the following line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[6]:\n\n    \nlsoas.plot()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[6]:\n\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x10e05f890&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis might not be the most aesthetically pleasant visual representation of the LSOAs geography, but it is hard to argue it is not quick to produce.

In this section, we will explore some of the basic elements that will allow us to obtain more compelling maps.\nNOTE: some of these variations are very straightforward while others are more intricate and require tinkering with the internal parts of a plot. They are not necessarily organized by increasing level of complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging transparency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intensity of color of a polygon can be easily changed through the alpha attribute in plot. This is specified as a value betwee zero and one, where the former is entirely transparent while the latter is the fully opaque (maximum intensity):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[13]:\n\n    \nlsoas.plot(alpha=0.1)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[13]:\n\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x111808a50&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[14]:\n\n    \nlsoas.plot(alpha=1)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[14]:\n\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x112750a90&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving axes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough in some cases, the axes can be useful to obtain context, most of the times maps look and feel better without them. Removing the axes involves wrapping the plot into a figure, which takes a few more lines of aparently useless code but that, in time, it will allow you to tweak the map further and to create much more flexible designs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[15]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nax = lsoas.plot(axes=ax)\nax.set_axis_off()\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us stop for a second a study each of the previous lines:\n\nWe have first created a figure named f with one axis named ax by using the command plt.subplots (part of the library matplotlib, which we have imported at the top of the notebook). Note how the method is returning two elements and we can assign each of them to objects with different name (f and ax) by simply listing them at the front of the line, separated by commas.\nSecond, we plot the geographies as before, but this time we tell the function that we want it to draw the polygons on the axis we are passing, ax. This method returns the axis with the geographies in them, so we make sure to store it on an object with the same name, ax.\nOn the third line, we effectively remove the box with coordinates.\nFinally, we draw the entire plot by calling plt.show().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a title is a simple extra line, if we are creating the plot within a figure, as we just did. To include text on top of the figure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[16]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nax = lsoas.plot(axes=ax)\nf.suptitle(&#39;Liverpool LSOAs&#39;)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the size of the map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe size of the plot is changed equally easily in this context. The only difference is that it is specified when we create the figure with the argument figsize. The first number represents the width, the X axis, and the second corresponds with the height, the Y axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[17]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12, 12))\nax = lsoas.plot(axes=ax)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling plots\n\nYou will notice that the ability to change the size of the figure is very powerful as it makes possible to obtain many different sizes and shapes for plots. However, this also may introduce some distortions in the way the shapes are represented. For example, a very wide figure can make the viewer think that polygons are in reality more \"stretched out\" than they are in reality:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[18]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12, 4))\nax = lsoas.plot(axes=ax)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough in some contexts this may be desirable (or at least, accepted), in many it will not. From a cartographic point of view, maps need to be as good representatios of reality as they can. We can ensure the scaling ratio between both axes remains fixed, whichever the shape of the figure. To do this, we only need to add a single extra line of code: plt.axis(\"equal\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[19]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12, 4))\nax = lsoas.plot(axes=ax)\nlims = plt.axis(&#39;equal&#39;)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifying borders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder lines sometimes can distort or impede proper interpretation of a map. In those cases, it is useful to know how they can be modified. Although not too complicated, the way to access borders in geopandas is not as straightforward as it is the case for other aspects of the map, such as size or frame. Let us first see the code to make the lines thinner and grey, and then we will work our way through the different steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[20]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nfor poly in lsoas[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multipolygon(ax, poly, linewidth=0.1, edgecolor=&#39;grey&#39;)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how the lines are much thinner and discreet. In addition, because of the way we plot the data, all the polygons are colored in the same (default) color, light red.\nLet us examine line by line what we are doing in the code snippet:\n\nWe begin by creating the figure (f) object and one axis inside it (ax) where we will plot the map.\nThen, instead of calling the utility function plot on the DataFrame, we loop over every element of the column geometry. As we know from above, this dataset contains polygons representing areas of Liverpool, represented geometrically in polygons. For convenience, we call them in the loop poly.\nLine 3 is the crucial part in the cell. In there, we plot each of the polygons individually, using the function plot_multipolygon, which in part of the plotting submodule in geopandas (which, recall, we have renamed gpd for convenience). The way this function works is you need to always pass the axis (ax in this case) where the geometry will be drawn, then the actual geometry (poly here), and then you can optionally pass some arguments that tweak the default appearance. Accessing each polygon at once affords us further flexibility and allows us to set the width of the border lines (linewidth) as well as their colors (edgecolor). Note that, because we are plotting at the polygon level, instead of at the DataFrame level, each polygon is colored in the same way.\nDraw the map using plt.show().\n\nNote that we are calling the fuction plot_multipolygon. This is so because we know we want to plot polygons. If instead we wanted to display lines, as those we read into rwy_tun, we would take a similar approach, but using plot_multilinestring:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[21]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nfor line in rwy_tun[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multilinestring(ax, line, linewidth=2, color=&#39;red&#39;)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant, note that in the case of lines the parameter to control the color is simply color. This is because lines do not have an area, so there is no need to distinguish between the main area (facecolor) and the border lines (edgecolor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a single color for every polygon\n\nIf you understand the logic behind plotting elements individually, as shown above, modifying the color of the polygon itself is very straightforward, you only need to tweak the parameter facecolor to your preferred color. For instance, let us draw the borders without coloring the polygons, leaving them white:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[22]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nfor poly in lsoas[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multipolygon(ax, poly, facecolor=&#39;white&#39;)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransforming CRS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coordindate reference system (CRS) is the way geographers and cartographers have to represent a three-dimentional object, such as the round earth, on a two-dimensional plane, such as a piece of paper or a computer screen. If the source data contain information on the CRS of the data, it is very easy to modify this in a GeoDataFrame. First let us check if we have the information stored properly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[23]:\n\n    \nlsoas.crs\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[23]:\n\n\n\n{u&apos;datum&apos;: u&apos;OSGB36&apos;,\n u&apos;k&apos;: 0.9996012717,\n u&apos;lat_0&apos;: 49,\n u&apos;lon_0&apos;: -2,\n u&apos;no_defs&apos;: True,\n u&apos;proj&apos;: u&apos;tmerc&apos;,\n u&apos;units&apos;: u&apos;m&apos;,\n u&apos;x_0&apos;: 400000,\n u&apos;y_0&apos;: -100000}\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, there is information stored about the reference system: it is using the datum \"OSGB36\", which is a projection in meters (m in units). There are also other less decipherable parameters but we do not need to worry about them right now.\nIf we want to modify this and \"reproject\" the polygons into a different CRS, the easiest way is to find the EPSG code online (epsg.io is a good one, although there are others too). For example, if we wanted to transform the dataset into lat/lon coordinates, we would use its EPSG code, 4326:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[24]:\n\n    \nlsoas.to_crs(epsg=4326).plot()\nlims = plt.axis(&#39;equal&#39;)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the area we are visualizing is not very large, the shape of the polygons is roughly the same. However, note how the scale in which they are plotted differs: while before we had coordinate points ranging 332,000 to 398,000, now these are expressed in degrees, and range from -3.05 to -2,80 on the longitude, and between 53.32 and 53.48 on the latitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional exercise]\nMake a map of the LSOAs that features the following characteristics:\n\nIncludes a title\nDoes not include axes frame\nIt is proportioned and has a figure size of 10 by 11.\nPolygons are all in the color \"#525252\" and fully opaque.\nLines have a width of 0.3 and are of color \"#B9EBE3\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComposing multi-layer maps&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have considered many aspects of plotting a single layer of data. However, in many cases, an effective map will require more than one: for example we might want to display streets on top of the polygons of neighborhoods, and add a few points for specific locations we want to highlight. At the very heart of GIS is the possibility to combine spatial information from different sources by overlaying it on top of each other, and this is fully supported in Python.\nEssentially, combining different layers on a single map boils down to adding each of them to the same axis in a sequential way, as if we were literally overlaying one on top of the previous one. For example, let us get the simplest possible plot, one with the polygons from the LSOAs and the tunnels on top of them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[25]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nlsoas.plot(axes=ax)\nrwy_tun.plot(axes=ax)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the default colors are not really designed to mix and match several layers, it is hard to tell them apart. However, we can use all the skills and tricks learned on styling a single layer, to make a multi-layer more sophisticated and, ultimately, useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[26]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n# Plot polygons in light grey\nfor poly in lsoas[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multipolygon(ax, poly, facecolor=&#39;grey&#39;, alpha=0.25, linewidth=0.1)\n# Overlay railway tunnels on top in strong green\nfor line in rwy_tun[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multilinestring(ax, line, color=&#39;green&#39;, linewidth=3)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional exercise]\nCreate a similar map to the one above, but replace the railway tunnels by the named places points used at the beginning (and saved into namp). Do not try to set the color to green or any other particular one, but you can play with the size of the dot.\nPro-tip: keep in mind you are plotting points no lines, so be sure to check the help of the function gpd.plotting.plot_point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving maps to figures&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have produced a map we are content with, we might want to save it to a file so we can include it into a report, article, website, etc. Exporting maps in Python is as simple as replacing plt.show by plt.savefig at the end of the code block to specify where and how to save it. For example to save the previous map into a png file in the same folder where the notebook is hosted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[27]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n# Plot polygons in light grey\nfor poly in lsoas[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multipolygon(ax, poly, facecolor=&#39;grey&#39;, alpha=0.25, linewidth=0.1)\n# Overlay railway tunnels on top in strong green\nfor line in rwy_tun[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multilinestring(ax, line, color=&#39;green&#39;, linewidth=3)\nplt.savefig(&#39;liverpool_railway_tunels.png&#39;)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you now check on the folder, you'll find a png (image) file with the map.\nThe command plt.savefig contains a large number of options and additional parameters to tweak. Given the size of the figure created is not very large, we can increase this with the argument dpi, which stands for \"dots per inch\" and it's a standard measure of resolution in images. For example, for a high definition (HD) quality image, we can use 1080:\n[Note]: if this takes too long, try with 500 instead, which will still give you a good quality image that renders more easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[28]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n# Plot polygons in light grey\nfor poly in lsoas[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multipolygon(ax, poly, facecolor=&#39;grey&#39;, alpha=0.25, linewidth=0.1)\n# Overlay railway tunnels on top in strong green\nfor line in rwy_tun[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multilinestring(ax, line, color=&#39;green&#39;, linewidth=3)\nplt.savefig(&#39;liverpool_railway_tunels.png&#39;, dpi=1080)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nManipulating spatial tables (GeoDataFrames)&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have an understanding of how to visually display spatial information contained, let us see how it can be combined with the operations learnt in the previous session about manipulating non-spatial tabular data. Essentially, the key is to realize that a GeoDataFrame contains most of its spatial information in a single column named geometry, but the rest of it looks and behaves exactly like a non-spatial DataFrame (in fact, it is). This concedes them all the flexibility and convenience that we saw in manipulating, slicing, and transforming tabular data, with the bonus that spatial data is carried away in all those steps. In addition, GeoDataFrames also incorporate a set of explicitly spatial operations to combine and transform data. In this section, we will consider both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us refresh some of the techniques we learned in the previous session about non-spatial tabular data and see how those can be combined with the mapping of their spatial counter-parts. To do this, we will revisit the population data we explored in the previous section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[29]:\n\n    \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Set the path to the location of the Liverpool Census Data-Pack,\n# just as you did at the beginning of the previous session\npath = &#39;../../../../data/Liverpool/&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember the data we want need to be extracted and renamed for the variables to have human readable names. Here we will do it all in one shot, but you can go back to the notebook of the previous session to follow the steps in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[30]:\n\n    \n# Read original table\nlsoa_orig = pd.read_csv(path+&#39;tables/QS203EW_lsoa11.csv&#39;, index_col=&#39;GeographyCode&#39;)\n# Select necessary variables\nregion_codes = [&#39;QS203EW0002&#39;, &#39;QS203EW0032&#39;, &#39;QS203EW0045&#39;, \\\n                &#39;QS203EW0063&#39;, &#39;QS203EW0072&#39;]\nlsoa_orig_sub = lsoa_orig.loc[:, region_codes]\n# Rename variables from codes into names\nvariables = pd.read_csv(path+&#39;variables_description.csv&#39;, index_col=0)\ncode2name = {}\nlookup_table = variables.set_index(&#39;ColumnVariableCode&#39;) # Reindex to be able to query\nfor code in region_codes:\n    code2name[code] = lookup_table.loc[code, &#39;ColumnVariableDescription&#39;]\nfor code in code2name:\n    code2name[code] = code2name[code].replace(&#39;: Total&#39;, &#39;&#39;)\nlsoa_orig_sub = lsoa_orig_sub.rename(columns=code2name)\n# Calculate total populations by area\nlsoa_orig_sub[&#39;Total&#39;] = lsoa_orig_sub.sum(axis=1)\nlsoa_orig_sub.head()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[30]:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Europe\n      Africa\n      Middle East and Asia\n      The Americas and the Caribbean\n      Antarctica and Oceania\n      Total\n    \n    \n      GeographyCode\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      E01006512\n      910\n      106\n      840\n      24\n      0\n      1880\n    \n    \n      E01006513\n      2225\n      61\n      595\n      53\n      7\n      2941\n    \n    \n      E01006514\n      1786\n      63\n      193\n      61\n      5\n      2108\n    \n    \n      E01006515\n      974\n      29\n      185\n      18\n      2\n      1208\n    \n    \n      E01006518\n      1531\n      69\n      73\n      19\n      4\n      1696\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin tabular data\n\nNow we have both tables loaded into the session: on the one hand, the spatial data are contained in lsoas, while all the tabular data are in lsoa_orig_sub. To be able to work with the two together, we need to connect them. In pandas language, this is called \"join\" and the key element in joins are the indices, the names assigned to each row of the tables. This is what we determine, for example, when we indicate index_col when reading a csv. In the case above, the index is set on GeographyCode. In the case of the GeoDataFrame, there is not any specific index, but a simple unamed sequence. The spatial table does have however a column called LSOA11CD which represents the code for each polygon, and this one actually matches those in GeographyCode in the population table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[31]:\n\n    \nlsoas.head()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[31]:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      LSOA11CD\n      geometry\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      E01006512\n      POLYGON ((336103.358 389628.58, 336103.416 389...\n    \n    \n      1\n      E01006513\n      POLYGON ((335173.781 389691.538, 335169.798 38...\n    \n    \n      2\n      E01006514\n      POLYGON ((335495.676 389697.267, 335495.444 38...\n    \n    \n      3\n      E01006515\n      POLYGON ((334953.001 389029, 334951 389035, 33...\n    \n    \n      4\n      E01006518\n      POLYGON ((335354.015 388601.947, 335354 388602...\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving the same column, albeit named differently, in both tables thus allows us to combine, \"join\", the two into a single one where rows are matched that we will call geo_pop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[32]:\n\n    \ngeo_pop = lsoas.join(lsoa_orig_sub, on=&#39;LSOA11CD&#39;)\ngeo_pop.head()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[32]:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      LSOA11CD\n      geometry\n      Europe\n      Africa\n      Middle East and Asia\n      The Americas and the Caribbean\n      Antarctica and Oceania\n      Total\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      E01006512\n      POLYGON ((336103.358 389628.58, 336103.416 389...\n      910\n      106\n      840\n      24\n      0\n      1880\n    \n    \n      1\n      E01006513\n      POLYGON ((335173.781 389691.538, 335169.798 38...\n      2225\n      61\n      595\n      53\n      7\n      2941\n    \n    \n      2\n      E01006514\n      POLYGON ((335495.676 389697.267, 335495.444 38...\n      1786\n      63\n      193\n      61\n      5\n      2108\n    \n    \n      3\n      E01006515\n      POLYGON ((334953.001 389029, 334951 389035, 33...\n      974\n      29\n      185\n      18\n      2\n      1208\n    \n    \n      4\n      E01006518\n      POLYGON ((335354.015 388601.947, 335354 388602...\n      1531\n      69\n      73\n      19\n      4\n      1696\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us quickly run through the logic of joins:\n\nFirst, it is an operation in which you are \"attaching\" some data to a previously existing one. This does not always need to be like this but, for now, we will only consider this case. In particular, in the operation above, we are attaching the population data in lsoa_orig_sub to the spatial table lsoas.\nSecond, note how the main table does not need to be indexed in the shared column for the join to be possible, it only needs to contain it. In this case, the index of lsoas is a simple sequence, but the relevant codes are stored in the column LSOA11CD.\nThird, the table that is being attached does need to be indexed on the relevant column. This is fine with us because lsoa_orig_sub is already indexed on the relevant ID codes.\nFinally, note how the join operation contains two arguments: one is obviously the table we want to attach; the second one, preceded by \"on\" relates to the column in the main table that is required to be matched with the index of the table being attached. In this case, the relevant ID codes are in the column LSOA11CD, so we specify that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne final note, there appears to be a bug in the code that makes the joined table to loose the CRS. Reattaching it is straightforward:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[33]:\n\n    \ngeo_pop.crs = lsoas.crs\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-spatial manipulations&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have joined spatial and non-spatial data, we can use the techniques learned in manipulating and slicing non-spatial tables to create much richer maps. In particular, let us recall the example we worked through in the previous session in which we were selecting rows based on their population characteristics. In addition to being able to to select them, now we will also be able to visualize them in maps.\nFor example, let us select again the ten smallest areas of Liverpool (note how we pass a number to head to keep that amount of rows):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[34]:\n\n    \nsmallest = geo_pop.sort(&#39;Total&#39;).head(10)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can make a map of Liverpool and overlay on top of them these areas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[35]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(6, 6))\n# Base layer with all the areas for the background\nfor poly in geo_pop[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multipolygon(ax, poly, facecolor=&#39;black&#39;, linewidth=0.025)\n# Smallest areas\nfor poly in smallest[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multipolygon(ax, poly, alpha=1, facecolor=&#39;red&#39;, linewidth=0)\nax.set_axis_off()\nf.suptitle(&#39;Areas with smallest population&#39;)\nplt.axis(&#39;equal&#39;)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional exercise.

The following command will return a GeoSeries (a single column with spatial data) with the centroids of a polygon GeoDataFrame:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[36]:\n\n    \ncents = geo_pop.centroid\ncents.head()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[36]:\n\n\n\n0     POINT (336154.2863649924 389733.635773753)\n1    POINT (335535.9278617767 390060.8596847057)\n2    POINT (335525.0607160075 389484.4020273419)\n3    POINT (335117.4359614222 389195.6749620197)\n4     POINT (335532.691301766 388692.8415110898)\ndtype: object\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how cents is not an entire table but a single column, or a GeoSeries object. This means you can plot it directly, just like a table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[37]:\n\n    \ncents.plot()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[37]:\n\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x116c70f90&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you don't need to call a geometry column to inspect the spatial objects. In fact, if you do it will return an error because there is not any geometry column, the object cents itself is the geometry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional exercise]\nCreate a map with the polygons of Liverpool in the background and overlay on top of them their centroids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint in polygon (PiP)\n\nKnowing whether a point is inside a polygon is conceptually a simple exercise but computationally a tricky task to perform. The simplest way to perform this operation in GeoPandas is through the contains method, available for each polygon object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[38]:\n\n    \npoly = geo_pop[&#39;geometry&#39;][0]\npt1 = cents[0]\npt2 = cents[1]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[39]:\n\n    \npoly.contains(pt1)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[39]:\n\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[40]:\n\n    \npoly.contains(pt2)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[40]:\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming point-in-polygon in this way is instructive and useful for pedagogical reasons, but for cases with many points and polygons, it is not particularly efficient. In these situations, it is much more advisable to perform then as a \"spatial join\". If you are interested in these, see the link provided below to learn more about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional exercise]\nThis one is fairly advanced, so do not dispair if you cannot solve it. Find in which polygons the named places in namp fall into. Return, for each named place, the LSOA code in which it is located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffers\n\nBuffers are one of the classical GIS operations in which an area is drawn around a particular geometry, given a specific radious. These are very useful, for instance, in combination with point-in-polygon operations to calculate accessibility, catchment areas, etc.\nTo create a buffer using geopandas, simply call the buffer method, passing in the radious. Mind that the radious needs to be specified in the same units as the CRS of the geography you are working with. For example, for the named places, we can consider their CRS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[41]:\n\n    \nnamp.crs\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[41]:\n\n\n\n{&apos;init&apos;: u&apos;epsg:27700&apos;}\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tells us it uses projection 27700 in the EPSG system. If we look it up, we will find that this corresponds with the Ordnance Survey projection, which is expressed in metres. Hence if we want, for example, a buffer of 500m. around each of these places, we can simply obtain it by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[42]:\n\n    \nbuf = namp.buffer(500)\nbuf.head()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[42]:\n\n\n\n0    POLYGON ((340105 396261, 340102.5923633361 396...\n1    POLYGON ((340258 392357, 340255.5923633361 392...\n2    POLYGON ((340268 392217, 340265.5923633361 392...\n3    POLYGON ((340769 396567, 340766.5923633361 396...\n4    POLYGON ((340796 395304, 340793.5923633361 395...\ndtype: object\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd plotting it is equally straighforward:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[43]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n# Plot buffer\nfor poly in buf:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multipolygon(ax, poly, linewidth=0)\n# Plot named places on top for reference\nnamp.plot(axes=ax)\nplt.axis(&#39;equal&#39;)\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional exercise]\nGenerate a map of the Liverpool polygons in black and overlay on top of them yellow buffers of 250 metres around each centroid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE The folowing are extensions and as such are not required to complete this section. They are intended as additional resources to explore further possibilities that Python allows to play with representing spatial data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Extension I] Creating interactive maps&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[44]:\n\n    \nimport mplleaflet\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing interactivity in cartography is a huge subfield that involves many considerations, most of them going well beyond the scope of this course. However, for very simple cases, it is straightforward to add geometries (points, polygons, lines) from a GeoDataFrame to a web map based on OpenStreetMap, for example. This can be done using the additional library mplleaflet.\nAs an illustration, we will display the LSOA polygons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[45]:\n\n    \nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nfor line in rwy_tun[&#39;geometry&#39;]:\n    gpd.plotting.plot_multilinestring(ax, line, color=&#39;yellow&#39;, linewidth=3)\nmplleaflet.display(fig=f, crs=rwy_tun.crs)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[45]:\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that essentially, all it takes is to produce the map in the standard way and, at the end of the code block, add a line that passes the figure object (f) and the CRS into the converter that will return the interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional exercise. Difficulty: 2/5]\nCreate an interactive map of the smallest population areas in Liverpool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Extension II] Adding base layers from raster imagery&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, in addition to vector data, we need to rely on raster sources and combine both in the same map. For all things raster, Python has the library rasterio, which provides simplified access to raster sources and many tools for manipulation, transformation, and integration.\nIn this example (based on this other one by Carson Farmer), we read in open data from the Ordnance Survey for the whole UK. The data corresponds with the GB Overview Map, and is obtained through an OS Open Data license. The original source file can be downloaded from the following link:\nhttps://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo import the data using rasterio, we need to run the following code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[46]:\n\n    \nimport rasterio\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Reading in data\nsource = rasterio.open(&#39;figs/lab03_GBOverview.tif&#39;, &#39;r&#39;)\nred = source.read(1)\ngreen = source.read(2)\nblue = source.read(3)\npix = np.dstack((red, green, blue))\nbounds = (source.bounds.left, source.bounds.right, \\\n          source.bounds.bottom, source.bounds.top)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have the data read, plotting it follows a similar pattern as we have seen before, except now we are using the plt.imshow command, which displays an image:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[47]:\n\n    \n# Plotting\nf = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nax = plt.imshow(pix, extent=bounds)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional exercise]\nReproduce the raster map above in larger size (e.g. 14 by 14) and add the polygons of Liverpool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Extension III] Advanced GIS operations&#182;[NOTE] If you are going to try some of these operations, make sure to have the library rtree correctly installed.\n\nSpatial joins\n\nhttps://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/blob/master/examples/spatial_joins.ipynb\n\n\nSpatial overlays\n\nhttps://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/blob/master/examples/overlays.ipynb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Data Science'15 - Lab 3 by Dani Arribas-Bel is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\n"},"chapter-1/lab_01.html":{"url":"chapter-1/lab_01.html","title":"Subchapter 1.5","body":"\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Data Science - Lab 01&#182;Dani Arribas-Bel\nComputational tools for Geographic Data Science&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this first tutorial we will introduce the main tools we will be working with throughout the rest of the course. Although very basic and seemingly abstract, everything showed here will become the basis on top of which we will build more sophisticated (and fun) tasks. But, before, let us get to know the tools that will give us data super-powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Source&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course will introduce you to a series of computational tools that make the life of the Data Scientist possible, and much easier. All of them are open-source, which means the creators of these pieces of software have made available the source code for people to use it, study it, modify it, and re-distribute it. This has allowed a large eco-system that today represents the best option for scientific computing, and is used widely both in industry and academia. Thanks to this, this course can be taught with entirely freely available tools that you can install in any of your computers.\nIf you want to learn more about open-source and free software, here are a few links:\n\n[Video]: brief explanation of open source.\n[Book] The Cathedral and the Bazaar: classic book, freely available, that documents the benefits and history of open-source software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter Notebook&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main computational tool you will be using during this course is the Jupyter notebook. Notebooks are a convenient way to thread text, code and the output it produces in a simple file that you can then share, edit and modify. You can think of notebooks as the Word document of Data Scientists, just better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a notebook&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to begin a notebook session, you need to do it from what is called the command line, a terminal window that allows you to interact with your computer through written commands. This is how you can fire up a terminal:\n\nIf you are on a Windows computer, you can start PowerShell from the Start menu (cmd prompt). \nOn a Mac, fire up the Terminal.app utility. \nIn Linux, use any of the terminals available.\n\nThen type the following command\n\n&gt; source activate gds\nNOTE: ignore source if you are on Windows and simply type activate gds.\nThen launch Jupyter by typing on the same terminal:\n\n&gt; jupyter notebook\nThis should bring up a browser window with a home page that looks more or less like this (although with a different list of files probably):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate until the folder where you have placed the lab_01.ipynb file for this tutorial and click on it. This will open the notebook on a different tab. You are now on the interactive version of the notebook!\nWhen you are finished with the session, you can save the notebook with File -&gt; Save and Checkpoint. Everything you do on the notebook (text, code and output) is saved into an .ipynb file that you can open later, share, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCells&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main building block of notebooks are cells. These are chunks of the same time of content which can be cut, pasted, and moved around in a notebook. Cells can be of two types:\n\nText, like the one where this is written.\nCode, like the following one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[1]:\n\n    \n# This is a code cell\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create a new cell by clicking Insert -&gt; Cell Above/Below in the top menu. By default, this will be a code cell, but you can change that on the Cell -&gt; Cell Type menu. Choose Markdown for a text cell. Once a new cell is created, you can edit it by clicking on it, which will create the cursor bar inside for you to start typing.\nPro tip!: cells can also be created with shortcuts. If you press &lt;escape&gt; and then b (a), a new cell will be created below (above). There is a whole bunch of shortcuts you can explore by pressing &lt;escape&gt; and h (press &lt;escape&gt; again to leave the help).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and its output&#182;A particularly useful feature of notebooks is that you can save, in the same place, the code you use to generate any output (tables, figures, etc.). As an example, the cell below contains a snipet of Python that returns a printed statement. This statement is then printed below and recorded in the notebook as output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[2]:\n\n    \nprint(&quot;Hello world!!!&quot;)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello world!!!\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote also how the notebook has automatic syntax highlighting support for Python. This makes the code much more readable and understandable. More on Python below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText cells in a notebook use the Github Flavored Markdown markup language. This means you can write plain text with some rules and the notebook renders a more visually appealing version of it. Let's see some examples:\n\nBOLD:\n\nThis is **bold**.\nIs rendered:\nThis is bold.\n\nITALIC:\n\nThis is *italic*.\nIs rendered:\nThis is italic.\n\nLISTS:\n\nYou can create unnumbered lists:\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2\n* ...\nWhich will produce:\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\n...\n\nOr you can create numbered lists:\n\n1. First element\n1. Second element\n1. ...\nAnd get:\n\nFirst element\nSecond element\n...\n\nNote that you don't have to write the actual number of the element, just using 1. always produces a numbered list.\nYou can also nest lists:\n\n* First unnumbered element, which can be split into:\n\n    1. One numbered element\n    2. Another numbered element\n\n* Second element.\n* ...\n\nFirst unnumbered element, which can be split into:\n\nOne numbered element\nAnother numbered element\n\n\nSecond element.\n\n...\n\nThis creates many oportunities to combine things nicely.\n\nLINKS\n\nYou can easily create hyperlinks, for example to [WikiPedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).\nYou can easily create hyperlinks, for example to WikiPedia.\n\nHEADINGS: including # before a line causes it to render a heading.\n\n\n# This is Header 1\nTurns into:\nThis is Header 1&#182;\n## This is Header 2\nTurns into:\nThis is Header 2&#182;\n### This is Header 3\nTurns into:\nThis is Header 3&#182;And so on...\n\nYou can see a more in detail introduction in the following links:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRich content in a notebook&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotebooks can also include rich content from the web. For that, we need to import the display module:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[3]:\n\n    \nimport IPython.display as display\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes available additional functionality that allows us to embed rich content. For example, we can include a YouTube clip easily by passing it's ID:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[4]:\n\n    \ndisplay.YouTubeVideo(&#39;iinQDhsdE9s&#39;)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[4]:\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can pass standard HTML code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[5]:\n\n    \ndisplay.HTML(&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Header 1&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Header 2&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[5]:\n\n\n\n\nHeader 1\nHeader 2\n\n\nrow 1, cell 1\nrow 1, cell 2\n\n\nrow 2, cell 1\nrow 2, cell 2\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this opens the door for including a large number of elements from the web, as an iframe is also allowed. For example, interactive maps can be included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[6]:\n\n    \nosm = &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=-2.9662737250328064%2C53.400500637844594%2C-2.964626848697662%2C53.402550738394034&amp;amp;layer=mapnik&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/53.40153/-2.96545&quot;&gt;View Larger Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\ndisplay.HTML(osm)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[6]:\n\n\n\nView Larger Map\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr sound content:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[7]:\n\n    \nsound = &#39;&#39;&#39;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178720725&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&#39;&#39;&#39;\ndisplay.HTML(sound)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[7]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nA more thorough exploration of them is available in this notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise to work on your own&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to reproduce, using markdown and the different tools the notebook affords you, the following WikiPedia entry:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_chip_cookie_dough_ice_cream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[8]:\n\n    \ndisplay.IFrame(&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_chip_cookie_dough_ice_cream&#39;, \n              700, 500)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[8]:\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nPay special attention in getting the bold, italics, links, headlines and lists correctly formated. Bonus if you manage to insert the image as well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we will have a look at other programs, the main bulk of the course relies on the Python programming language. Python is a high-level programming language widely used today. To give a couple of examples of its relevance, it is underlying most of the Dropbox systems, but also heavily used to control satellites at NASA. A great deal of Science is also done in Python, from research in astronomy at UC Berkley, to courses in economics by Nobel Prize Professors.\nThis course uses Python because it has emerged as one of the main and most solid options for Data Science, together with other free alternatives such as R. Python is widely used for data processing and analysis both in academia and in industry. There is a vibrant and growing scientific community (example and example), working at both universities and companies, that supports and enhances its capabilities for data analysis by providing new and refining existing extensions (a.ka.a. libraries, see below). In the geospatial world, Python is also very widely adopted, being the selected language for scripting in both ArcGIS and QGIS. All of this means that, whether you are thinking of continuing in Higher Education or trying to find a job in industry, Python will be an importan asset that employers will significantly value.\nBeing a high-level language means that the code can be \"dynamically interpreted\", which means it is run on-the-fly without the need to be compiled. This is in contrast to \"low-level\" programming languages, which first need to be converted into machine code (i.e. compiled) before they can be run. With Python, one does not need to worry about compilation and can just write code, evaluate, fix it, re-evaluate it, etc. in a quick cycle, making it a very productive tool. The rest of this tutorial covers some of the basic elements of the language, from conventions like how to comment your code, to the basic data structures available.\nThe rest of the tutorial is partly inspired by the introductory lesson in this course by Lorena Barba's group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython libraries&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard Python language includes some data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries, etc. See below) and allows many basic operations (e.g. sum, product, etc.). For example, right out of the box, and without any further action needed, you can use Python as a calculator:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[9]:\n\n    \n3 + 5\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[9]:\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[10]:\n\n    \n2. / 3\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[10]:\n\n\n\n0.6666666666666666\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[11]:\n\n    \n(3 + 5) * 2. / 3\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[11]:\n\n\n\n5.333333333333333\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the strength of Python as a data analysis tool comes from the extensions provided separately that add functionality and provide access to much more sophisticated data structures and functions. These come in the form of packages, or libraries, that once installed need to be imported into a session.\nIn this course, we will be using many of the core libraries of what has been called the \"PyData stack\", the set of libraries that make Python a full-fledge system for Data Science. We will introduce them gradually as we need them for particular tasks but, for now, let us have a look at the foundational library, numpy (short for numerical Python). Importing it is simple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[12]:\n\n    \nimport numpy as np # we rename it in the session as `np` by convention\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how we import it and rename it in the session, from numpy to np, which is shorter and more convenient.\nNote also how comments work in Python: everything in a line after the # sign is ignored by Python when it evaluates the code. This allows you to insert comments that Python will ignore but that can help you and others better understand the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce imports are out of the way, let us start exploring what we can do with numpy. One of the easiest tasks is to create a sequence of numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[13]:\n\n    \nseq = np.arange(10)\nseq\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[13]:\n\n\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note is that, in line 1, we create the sequence by calling the function arange and assign it to an object called seq (it could have been called anything else, pick your favorite) and, in line 2, we have it printed as the output of the cell.\nAnother interesting feature is how, since we are calling a numpy function called arange by adding np. in front. This is to note that the function comes explicitly from numpy. To find out how necessary this is, you can try generating the sequence without np:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[14]:\n\n    \nseq = arange(10)\nseq\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-14-8381d1c402c4&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()\n----&gt; 1 seq = arange(10)\n      2 seq\n\nNameError: name &apos;arange&apos; is not defined\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you get instead is an error, also called a \"traceback\". In particular, Python is telling that it cannot find a function named arange in the core library. This is because that particular function is only available in numpy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA basic feature of Python is the ability to assign a name to different \"things\", or objects. These can also be called sometimes \"variables\". We have already seen that in the example above but, to make it more explicit, let us make it even simpler. For example, an object can be a single number:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[15]:\n\n    \na = 3\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr a name, also called \"string\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[16]:\n\n    \nb = &#39;Hello World&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check what type an object is also easily:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[17]:\n\n    \ntype(a)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[17]:\n\n\n\nint\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nint is short for \"integer\" which, roughly speaking, means an whole number. If you want to save a number with decimals, you will be using floats:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[18]:\n\n    \nc = 1.5\ntype(c)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[18]:\n\n\n\nfloat\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, what we understand as letters in a wide sense (spaces and other signs count too) is called \"strings\" (str in short):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[19]:\n\n    \ntype(b)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[19]:\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA very handy feature of Python is the ability to access on-the-spot help for its different functions. This means that you can check what a function is supposed to do, or how to access it, right inside your Python session. Of course, this also works handsomely inside a notebook. There are a couple of ways to access the help.\nTake the numpy function arange that we have used above. The easiest way to check interactively how to use it is by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[20]:\n\n    \nnp.arange?\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this brings up a sub-window in the browser with all the information you need.\nIf, for whatever reason, you needed to print that info into the notebook itself, you can do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[21]:\n\n    \nhelp(np.arange)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp on built-in function arange in module numpy.core.multiarray:\n\narange(...)\n    arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)\n\n    Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.\n\n    Values are generated within the half-open interval &#96;&#96;[start, stop)&#96;&#96;\n    (in other words, the interval including &#96;start&#96; but excluding &#96;stop&#96;).\n    For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in\n    &#96;range &lt;http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html&gt;&#96;_ function,\n    but returns an ndarray rather than a list.\n\n    When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, the results will often not\n    be consistent.  It is better to use &#96;&#96;linspace&#96;&#96; for these cases.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    start : number, optional\n        Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default\n        start value is 0.\n    stop : number\n        End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except\n        in some cases where &#96;step&#96; is not an integer and floating point\n        round-off affects the length of &#96;out&#96;.\n    step : number, optional\n        Spacing between values.  For any output &#96;out&#96;, this is the distance\n        between two adjacent values, &#96;&#96;out[i+1] - out[i]&#96;&#96;.  The default\n        step size is 1.  If &#96;step&#96; is specified, &#96;start&#96; must also be given.\n    dtype : dtype\n        The type of the output array.  If &#96;dtype&#96; is not given, infer the data\n        type from the other input arguments.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    arange : ndarray\n        Array of evenly spaced values.\n\n        For floating point arguments, the length of the result is\n        &#96;&#96;ceil((stop - start)/step)&#96;&#96;.  Because of floating point overflow,\n        this rule may result in the last element of &#96;out&#96; being greater\n        than &#96;stop&#96;.\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    linspace : Evenly spaced numbers with careful handling of endpoints.\n    ogrid: Arrays of evenly spaced numbers in N-dimensions.\n    mgrid: Grid-shaped arrays of evenly spaced numbers in N-dimensions.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3)\n    array([0, 1, 2])\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3.0)\n    array([ 0.,  1.,  2.])\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3,7)\n    array([3, 4, 5, 6])\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.arange(3,7,2)\n    array([3, 5])\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nControl flow (a.k.a. for loops and if statements)&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this does not intend to be a comprehensive introduction to computer programming or general purpose Python (check the references for that, in particular Allen Downey's book), it is important to be aware of two building blocks of almost any computer program: for loops and if statements. It is possible that you will never require them for this course, as all that is used here is based on existing methods and functions, but it is always useful to know they exist and to be able to recognize them. They can also come in very handy in cases where you some extra functionality out of standard methods. Without further ado, let us have a look and the two single most relevant tools of computer programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor loops\n\nThese allow  you to repeat a particular action or task over a sequence. As an example, you can print your name ten times without having to type it yourself every single time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[22]:\n\n    \nfor i in np.arange(10):\n    print &#39;my name&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\nmy name\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote a couple of features in the loop:\n\nYou loop over a sequence, in this particular case the sequence of ten numbers created by np.arange(10).\nIn every step, for every element of the sequence in this case, you repeat an action. Here we are printing the same text, my name.\nAlthough not used in this simple loop, each of the elements you loop over can be accessed inside the loop. This can be irrelevant, as in the loop above, or extremely useful, it depends on the context. For example, see a case where you use the value of the sequence in each step:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[23]:\n\n    \nfor i in np.arange(10):\n    print &quot;I am at step &quot;, i\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am at step  0\nI am at step  1\nI am at step  2\nI am at step  3\nI am at step  4\nI am at step  5\nI am at step  6\nI am at step  7\nI am at step  8\nI am at step  9\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more note: for convention, we are calling the element of the sequence i, but this could be named anything. In fact, in many cases, more meaningful names make code much more readable. For example, you could think of a re-write of the loop above as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[24]:\n\n    \nfor step in np.arange(10):\n    print &quot;I am at step &quot;, step\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am at step  0\nI am at step  1\nI am at step  2\nI am at step  3\nI am at step  4\nI am at step  5\nI am at step  6\nI am at step  7\nI am at step  8\nI am at step  9\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif statements\n\nWe have just seen how for loops allow you to repeat an action over a sequence. In the case of if statements, these allow you to select or restrict such actions to only those cases that meet a condition(s) you specify in the statement.\nFor example, if you think of the loops written above, you might want to only print those that are odd, skipping those that are even:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[25]:\n\n    \nfor i in np.arange(10):\n    if i%2:\n        print i\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnore for the moment the part i%2, just remember this is one way Python has to check if a number is odd. The important bit in this loop, as compared to the simpler one above, is that we are using an if statement to select only those candidates that meet the condition. In other words, what we are doing it looping over every number in the sequence from zero to nine (for i in np.arange(10)) and checking if they are even or odd (if i%2). If they meet the condition, they are odd, then we proceed and print them on the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full if statement also allows for an action to be taken if the original condition is not satisfied. This is called an \"ifelse\" statement. For example, you can think of a loop that prints the type of each number in a sequence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[26]:\n\n    \nfor i in np.arange(10):\n    # Check if it is odd\n    if i%2:\n        print i, &#39; is odd&#39;\n    # If not odd (even), then do the following\n    else:\n        print i, &#39; is even&#39;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0  is even\n1  is odd\n2  is even\n3  is odd\n4  is even\n5  is odd\n6  is even\n7  is odd\n8  is even\n9  is odd\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nData structures&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard python you can access without importing any additional libraries contains a few core data structures that is very handy to know. Most of data analysis is done on top of other structures specifically designed for the purpose (numpy arrays and pandas dataframes, mostly. See the following sessions for more details), but some understanding of these core Python structures is very useful. In this context, we will look at three: values, lists, and dictionaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues: these are the most basic elements to organize data and information in Python. You can think of them as numbers (integers or floats) or words (strings). Typically, these are the elements that will be stored in lists and dictionaries.\n\nAn integer is a whole number:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[27]:\n\n    \ni = 5\ntype(i)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[27]:\n\n\n\nint\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nA float is a number that allows for decimals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[28]:\n\n    \nf = 5.2\ntype(f)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[28]:\n\n\n\nfloat\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that a float can also not have decimals and still be stored as such:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[29]:\n\n    \nfw = 5.\ntype(fw)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[29]:\n\n\n\nfloat\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, they are different representations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[30]:\n\n    \nf == fw\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[30]:\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists: a list is an ordered sequence of values that can be of mixed types. They are represented between squared brackets ([]) and, although not very efficient in memory terms, are very flexible and useful to \"put things together\".\n\nFor example, the following list of integers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[31]:\n\n    \nl = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nl\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[31]:\n\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[32]:\n\n    \ntype(l)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[32]:\n\n\n\nlist\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the following mixed one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[33]:\n\n    \nm = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 5, &#39;c&#39;, 6, 7]\nm\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[33]:\n\n\n\n[&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, 5, &apos;c&apos;, 6, 7]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLists can be queried and sliced. For example, the first element can be retrieved by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[34]:\n\n    \nl[0]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[34]:\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the second to the fourth:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[35]:\n\n    \nm[1:4]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[35]:\n\n\n\n[&apos;b&apos;, 5, &apos;c&apos;]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLists can be added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[36]:\n\n    \nl + m\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[36]:\n\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, 5, &apos;c&apos;, 6, 7]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNew elements added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[37]:\n\n    \nl.append(4)\nl\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[37]:\n\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOr modified:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[38]:\n\n    \nl[1]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[38]:\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[39]:\n\n    \nl[1] = &#39;two&#39;\nl[1]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[39]:\n\n\n\n&apos;two&apos;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[40]:\n\n    \nl\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[40]:\n\n\n\n[1, &apos;two&apos;, 3, 4, 5, 4]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries: dictionaries are unordered collections of \"keys\" and \"values\". A key, which can be of any kind, is the element associated with a \"value\", which can also be of any kind. Dictionaries are used when order is not important but you need fast and easy lookup. They are expressed in curly brackets, with keys and values being linked through columns.\n\nFor example, we can think of a dictionary to store a series of names and the ages of the people they represent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[41]:\n\n    \nages = {&#39;Ana&#39;: 24, &#39;John&#39;: 20, &#39;Li&#39;: 27, &#39;Ivan&#39;: 40, &#39;Tali&#39;:33}\nages\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[41]:\n\n\n\n{&apos;Ana&apos;: 24, &apos;Ivan&apos;: 40, &apos;John&apos;: 20, &apos;Li&apos;: 27, &apos;Tali&apos;: 33}\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[42]:\n\n    \ntype(ages)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[42]:\n\n\n\ndict\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries can then be queried and values retrieved easily by using their keys. For example, if we quickly want to know Li's age:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[43]:\n\n    \nages[&#39;Li&#39;]\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[43]:\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to lists, you can modify and assign new values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[44]:\n\n    \nages[&#39;Juan&#39;] = 73\nages\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[44]:\n\n\n\n{&apos;Ana&apos;: 24, &apos;Ivan&apos;: 40, &apos;John&apos;: 20, &apos;Juan&apos;: 73, &apos;Li&apos;: 27, &apos;Tali&apos;: 33}\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this property, you can create entirely empty dictionaries and populate them later on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[45]:\n\n    \nnewdict = {}\nnewdict[&#39;key1&#39;] = 1\nnewdict[&#39;key2&#39;] = 2\nnewdict\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[45]:\n\n\n\n{&apos;key1&apos;: 1, &apos;key2&apos;: 2}\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last part of this whirlwind tour on Python relates to functions, or more properly termed, methods. The motivation is that, so far, we have only seen how you can create Python code that, if you want to run again somewhere else, you need to copy and paste entirely. However, as we will see in more detail later in the course, one of the main reasons why you want to use Python for data analysis, instead of a point-and-click graphical interface like SPSS, for instance, is that you can easily reuse code and re-run analyses easily. Methods help us accomplish this by encapsulating snippets of code that perform a particular task and making them available to be called.\nWe have already used methods here. When we call np.arange, we are using one of them. Now, we will see how to create a method of our own that performs the specific task we want it to do. For example, let us create a very simple method to reproduce the first loop we created above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[46]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loop():\n    for i in np.arange(10):\n        print i\n    return None\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready with this simple method, there is a bunch of interesting things going on:\n\nFirst, note how we define a bit of code is a method, as oposed to plain Python: we use def followed by the name of our function (we have chosen run_simple_loop, but we anything could have done).\nSecond, we append () after the name, and finish the line with a colon (:). This is necessary and will allow us to specify requirements for the function (see below).\nThird, realize that everything inside a function needs to be indented. This is a core property of Python and, although some people find it odd, it enhances readibility greatly.\nFourth, the piece of code to do the task we want, printing the sequence of numbers, is inside the function in the same way it was outside, only properly indented.\nFifth, we finish the method with a line starting by return. In this case, we follow it with None, but this will change as methods become more sophisticated. Essentially, this is the part of the method where you specify which elements you want it to return and save for later use.\n\nOnce we have paid attention to these elements, we can see how the method can be called and hence the code inside it executed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[47]:\n\n    \nrun_simple_loop()\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the same way that we called np.arange before. Note how we do not include the colon (:) but simply use the name of the method followed by the parenthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the simplest possile method you can write: you do not require anything, just executing it, and the code produces and output (the printout) but it is not saved anywhere. The rest of this section relaxes these two aspects to allow us to build more complex, but also more useful, methods.\nFirst, you can specify \"arguments\" to be passed that modify the behaviour of the method. Remember how we called np.arange with a number that implied the length of the sequence we wanted returned. We can do the same thing in our own function. The main aspect to pay attention to in this context is that the arguments need to be variables, not particular values. Let us see a modified example of our method:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[48]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loopX(x):\n    for i in np.arange(x):\n        print i\n    return None\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have replaced the fixed length of the sequence (10) by a variable named x that allows us to specify any value we want when we call the method:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[49]:\n\n    \nrun_simple_loopX(3)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[50]:\n\n    \nrun_simple_loopX(2)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way you can build more flexibility into a method is by allowing it to return an output of the computation. In the previous examples, the function performs a computation (i.e. printing values on the screen), but it does not return any value. This is in contrast with, for example, np.arange which does return an output, the sequence of values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[51]:\n\n    \na = np.arange(10)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[52]:\n\n    \na\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[52]:\n\n\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOur function does not save anything:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[53]:\n\n    \nb = run_simple_loopX(3)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[54]:\n\n    \nb\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can modify this using the last line of a method. For example, let us assume we want to return a sequence as long as the series of numbers we print on the screen. The method should be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[55]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loopXout(x):\n    for i in np.arange(x):\n        print i\n    return np.arange(x)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the main difference: instead of returning None, we are telling Python to return a sequence, which has the same length as the one used to specify the loop. Now, there is an alternative way of being more efficient in this method, and that is assigning the sequence to a new object and using it when necessary later on. The results are exactly the same, but there are less computations performed and, more critically, we minimize the chances of making mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[56]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loopXout(x):\n    seq = np.arange(x)\n    for i in seq:\n        print i\n    return seq\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nEither of these two new versions of the method return an output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[57]:\n\n    \na = run_simple_loopX(3)\nb = run_simple_loopXout(3)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[58]:\n\n    \na\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[59]:\n\n    \nb\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\nOut[59]:\n\n\n\narray([0, 1, 2])\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of methods, as oposed to straight code, is that they force us to think in a modular way, helping us identify exactly what it needs to be done, in what order, and what it is required. Encapsulating these atomic bits of functionality in methods allows us to write things once and flexibly use them everywhere, saving us time (and headaches) in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA final note on functions. It is important that, whenever you create a function, you include some documentation about what it expects, what it does, and what it returns. Although there are many ways of doing this, the typical convention is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[60]:\n\n    \ndef run_simple_loopXout(x):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Print out the values of a sequence of certain length\n    ...\n    \n    Arguments\n    ---------\n    x     : int\n            Length of the sequence to be printed out\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    seq   : np.array\n            Sequence of values printed out\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    seq = np.arange(x)\n    for i in seq:\n        print i\n    return seq\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation, as any string, are highlighted in red on a notebook. Let us have a look at the structure and components of a well-made documentation (also called \"docstring\"):\n\nIt is encapsulated between triple commas (\"\"\").\nBegins with a short description of what the method does. The shorter the better, the more concise, the even better.\nThere is a section called \"Arguments\" that lists the elements that the function expects. \nEach argument is then listed, followed by its type. In this case it is an object x that, as we are told, needs to be an integer.\nThe arguments are followed by another section that specifies what the function returns, and of what type the output is.\n\nDocumentation in this way is very useful to remember what a function does, but also to force yourself to write clearer code. A bonus is that, if you include documentation in this way, it can be checked with the standard help or ? systems reviewed above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[61]:\n\n    \nrun_simple_loopXout?\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[62]:\n\n    \nhelp(run_simple_loopXout)\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp on function run_simple_loopXout in module __main__:\n\nrun_simple_loopXout(x)\n    Print out the values of a sequence of certain length\n    ...\n\n    Arguments\n    ---------\n    x     : int\n            Length of the sequence to be printed out\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    seq   : np.array\n            Sequence of values printed out\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise to work on your own&#182;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a properly documented function with the following behaviour:\n\nIt has a meaningful name (i.e. it is related to its behaviour).\nIt takes an integer that represents the length of a sequence that will be created.\nIt creates a dictionary that is empty.\nIt loops over the sequence and stores each number as the key of an entry in the dictionary, assigning either \"odd\" or \"even\" to the value, depending on the type of number.\nReturns the dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Data Science'15 - Lab 1 by Dani Arribas-Bel is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\n"}}}
